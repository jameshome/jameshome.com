    Stand still. The trees ahead and bush beside you<br />
    are not lost. Wherever you are is called Here,<br />
    And you must treat it as a powerful stranger,<br />
    Must ask permission to know it and be known.<br />
    The forest breathes. Listen. It answers,<br />
    I have made this place around you,<br />
    If you leave it you may come back again, saying Here.<br />
    No two trees are the same to Raven.<br />
    No two branches are the same to Wren.<br />
    If what a tree or a bush does is lost on you,<br />
    You are surely lost. Stand still. The forest knows<br />
    Where you are. You must let it find you.<br />
