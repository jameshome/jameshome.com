This is the best photograph we have of human civilization irrevocably crossing the most consequential threshold of the twentieth century.

Some call the time since this photograph was taken the [Long Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Peace). Some call it [Pax Atomica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Atomica). 

I suspect that the twenty-first century analog will be the emergence of superhuman machine intelligence, and that we’ll irrevocably cross that consequential threshold sometime in the next twenty years.

From them on we’ll then share our capacity for total annihilation with an intelligence that we won’t really understand. 

We have no idea how that’s going to go.

That probably would have broken the atom’s thrall over geopolitical entropy on its own, but the next twenty years will also see the start of the largest mass migration in human history as climates in heavily populated places around the world become intolerable.

In short, I think it’s going to keep getting weirder and that we’re all going to need each other more than ever. I’m grateful you’re here.
