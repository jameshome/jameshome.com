This is the best photograph we have of human civilization irrevocably crossing the most consequential threshold of the twentieth century.

Some call the time since this photograph was taken the [Long Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Peace). Some call it [Pax Atomica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Atomica). 

I suspect that the twenty-first century analog will be the emergence of superhuman machine intelligence, and that we’ll irrevocably cross that consequential threshold sometime in the next ten years.

From them on we’ll then share our capacity for total annihilation with an intelligence that we won’t really understand. 

We have no idea how that’s going to go.

That probably would have broken the atom’s thrall over geopolitical entropy on its own, but the next twenty years will also see the start of the largest mass migration in human history as climates in heavily populated places around the world become intolerable.

I'm open to the idea that together we can find ways to make these inevitable changes ones that strengthen our humanity. <a href="https://longnow.org/ideas/elements-of-a-durable-civilization/">Stewart Brand writes</a> that being obsessed with how civilization might end "takes our eye off the main event, which is how we manage civilization’s continuity. Continuity is made partly of exploration, but most of the work is maintenance." Brand quotes folk singer Pete Seeger: “You should consider that the essential art of civilization is maintenance.” 

Civilization-scale maintenance is inherently a community endeavor.

I think it’s going to keep getting weirder.  I think we’re all going to need each other more than ever. I’m grateful you’re here.
