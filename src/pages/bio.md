I’m a designer, technologist, adventurer, and mystic living up on the [Olympic Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Peninsula), in the heart of [Cascadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_movement). 

My work prioritizes curiosity over certainty, awareness over distraction, agency over convenience, and our natural world over virtual ones.

I lead communications and design for [The Long Now Foundation](https://longnow.org), a nonprofit founded in 01996 by [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand),  [Danny Hillis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Hillis), and [Brian Eno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno) to foster long-term thinking and responsibility. We encourage imagination at the timescale of civilization — the next and last 10,000 years — a timespan we call *the long now*.
